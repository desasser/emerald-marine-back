            intro: 'To ensure that marine employees are as safe as possible working on the water, water safety and man-overboard protection need to be built-in to the culture of the organization. However, studies have shown that occasional training programs are not as effective in ensuring safety. Water Safety Programs need to be demonstrated starting at the leadership level to be most effective. Making water safety part of the company culture. Pairing training with investment in water safety products and mechanisms help to make this a natural part of the culture. In a 2018 research essay written by Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev in Anthropology Today, studies show that short-term changes in training programs are not as effective as they should be. Dobbin and Kalev mention, “sometimes a short-term change occurs in attitudes, but very few find a widespread change in actual behavior.” Dobbin and Kalev offer a few reasons why these programs generally don’t work as intended.',
            sections: '{"heading1": "Why Water Safety Training Programs Don’t Always Work", "paragraph1": "First, “short-term educational interventions, in general, do not change people. This is true for worker safety courses. Second, some researchers argue that the training activates stereotypes in people’s minds rather than eliminating them. Third, training can make people complacent, thinking that because they went through the program they’ve solved the problem. Fourth, people don’t like to be told what to think and may rebel if they feel that they’re being pressured to think a certain way. Therefore it’s imperative for a successful training program to implement a solid policy to effect change, not a “check the box” culture that is easily dismissed.", "heading2": "Water Safety Needs to Start with Leadership", "paragraph2": "Emerald Marine Products has manufactured safety products for the maritime industry since 1996 and has partnered with dozens of other safety training institutions and product manufacturers. We have seen the successful implementation of safety procedures when the executive level of the company invests in product and policy creation that is used every day, not just quarterly or annually as required by some certification agencies. By instituting at the executive level it trickles into the entire company culture, making it feel intuitive and natural. When employees watch their leaders place a high value on safety and products that save lives, they will accept the reasoning behind use, training, and testing. When our ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System is part of the employee’s gear and tested every shift, it becomes second nature that a fall overboard situation could occur, the actions to reduce the possibility of a MOB is top of mind. This solidifies the learning by the employee.", "heading3": "Fighting Complacency and Building Confidence of Water Safety Training", "paragraph3": "One of our partner companies C-Hero goes one step further in engaging employees with their MOB retrieval products. C-Hero offers an e-Training program on their products and the process of recognizing a MOB incident and the procedures to retrieve the MOB. The training instructs the employees but also provides accountability of the training, including the requirement for the employee to be video recorded and submitting that video for certification. It almost becomes a “badge of honor” that the employee has demonstrated their ability and dedication to the life-saving procedure.", "heading4": "A Company Dedicated Solely to Water Safety Equipment and Training", "paragraph4": "Investment in dedicated equipment and “Practice Makes Permanent” is a thorough way of instilling a successful water safety program. When it comes to fall overboard awareness, practice, and retrieval, Emerald Marine Products offers products and partnerships that can be your one-source solution for instilling a MOB awareness/prevention safety culture.

A MOB alarm goes off within seconds of a man-overboard, allowing the Captain and crew to get an immediate visual of the MOB. Extending Man Overboard alert is crucial. A rescue operation is launched in under a minute. A life is saved! The same goes for a temporary work operation near water where someone inadvertently falls in the water. When the MOB alarm sounds, employees are notified in seconds and able to identify and rescue that person. ',

        //     paragraphs: ['The ability to relocate and extend the actual alarm is very important. Our ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System, the quickest responding MOB alerting system on the market, has an 85-decibel internal alarm in the Receiver that is typically installed in the wheelhouse. But the MOB alarm doesn’t have to remain in the wheelhouse. Extending the range of a man-overboard alarm is a key component and a unique feature of our fall in the water alerting products.', 'In the twenty-plus years Emerald Marine Products has been manufacturing fall overboard alerting and training products, we have seen the usage of our MOB devices go beyond the wheelhouse. Almost any place imaginable where employees are working on or near water, marine terminals, dredging operations, bridge construction, even water treatment plants have understood the need for a quick response to a person in the water.  Sometimes the 85-decibel internal alarm on the ALERT Receiver is not enough to make personnel aware of a fall in the water situation. Thankfully, all ALERT Receivers have “dry contacts” on the back of the units which allows for the addition of extended alerting capabilities.  With these contacts, you can attach a number of devices that operate by a “push of a button” or “click of a mouse.”', 'Over the years, many of our customers have gotten quite creative on how to extend man-overboard alerting. These solutions range from an external strobe or bull horn to communicating with remote data centers via the internet. At marine terminals, the ALERT Receiver is typically installed in an office which is great, but attaching a strobe or bull-horn can instantly alert employees on the dock of a MOB situation. Some companies have very remote locations where only two or three employees are working. These companies have used cell-phone auto-dial devices to call safety response personnel within seconds of a man-overboard alarm. Recently we became aware of one company using the OmniBeacon that functions as a strobe and an auto-dialer unit to extend alerting of a man-overboard. Emerald Marine Products is proud of our customers who take man-overboard awareness seriously enough to not only install our products. Furthermore, we are inspired by the creativity displayed inventing solutions at remote locations where launching a rescue might be hampered by a lack of personnel or equipment by extending the alert to centers where help can be activated.', 'Extending Man Overboard alert is crucial. Emerald Marine Products’ ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System can improve the safety of your employees regardless of where they are working on or near water.

        //     intro: 'Cost of implementing a man-overboard alerting system may be a barrier to saving lives. Knowing if a man-overboard situation (MOB) has occurred on your premises is what keeps executives and safety personnel up at night. Fortunately, a solution for detecting a MOB has been around for 20 years. Sometimes referred to as MOB Beacons, Marine Survivor Locator Device, or Locator Beacons, it’s all about technology that will alert of a fall overboard. Making a decision to invest in a man-overboard beacon system should be imperative for a company with employees working on or near water. However, the cost and time to implement a MOB alerting system can seem daunting. Emerald Marine Products has been protecting employees working on or near water for over twenty years so we have a clear understanding of the costs and time to implement a solution. We have a solution that is easy to implement and very cost-effective.',

        //     paragraphs: ['If you are involved in purchasing safety technology, one of your concerns is how long with MOB alerting technology last? Emerald Marine Products is proud of the fact that our man-overboard alerting devices have been serving the maritime industry for over twenty years. It is doubtful many of today’s Man Overboard Beacon vendors will be around that long. In our twenty-year span of business, we have seen other MOB Alerting products and technology go out of business. Bluetooth and AIS man-overboard products are very sexy and the rage for “the latest technology” but the truth is, Bluetooth and AIS man-overboard products can be very costly in the long run. Any technology that relies on Apps for use will require updates and continued technical support of its software. Bluetooth and AIS are reliant on other vendors’ products and this doubles or triples the concern for long-term longevity and support. Most systems are not “commercial-grade” and are not expandable. ALERT MOB alarm products do not require any software to operate. The ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System relies on the decades-old wireless transmission on the 418MHz frequency. No need for costly software or updates to keep the technology current. Bluetooth and AIS alerting systems may have an initial price less than our ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System but the TCO may take on a different cost once the longevity of the system is considered.', 'Many MOB Beacon App-based systems have a life expectancy of 2-3 years based on supporting software technology by the manufacturer or the operating system the apps need to function. Constant updating for bug fixes and security concerns are guaranteed. The ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System requires no software updates to remain functional. So when looking at the CTO of the ALERT MOB system, you simply need to look at the initial purchase price and any costs associated with new batteries or replacing a worn pouch or outer shell.', 'Last month, we received 40 ALERT2 Man-Overboard Alarm System Transmitters for a service check-up. This group of 40 allowed us to see how our man-overboard transmitters have fared over a span of time. We are happy to report that other than updating some worn pouches, outer shells, and batteries, the ALERT2 Transmitters were fully functioning. This proved that units in five-plus years of heavy maritime use may require a new pouch or batteries, but nothing more. In reviewing this sample group of 40 units, and many other servicing checks over the years, we have confirmed our products last 7plus years. Based on a lifetime of 7 years (at a minimum) at an initial cost of $274 plus one set of new batteries, the total cost for one transmitter per day for 7 years is $0.05/day. Assuming one ALERT2 Receiver will be needed to support five ALERT2 Transmitters (numbers will vary so we took an average). We calculated that the average life of a receiver is $0.44/day. As you increase the number of employees, you decrease the TCO of man-overboard alarm protection.', 'We have all heard of the analogy, “for the cost of a coffee at Starbucks you can…” We hate to use that analogy, but when it fits it fits. Using these sample figures previously outlined, a crew of five can be protected for $0.69 per day over a five-year period, A fleet of 10 boats and 40 crew can be protected for $6.40/day over a five-year period. If the TCO doesn’t convince your financial department, think of the money spent on a lawsuit for an injury or fatality when a life-saving product exists and wasn’t used.', 'Finally, with the simplicity of costs now comes, the simplicity of operation. With our newly released ALERT Portable, DIY Man-Overboard Alarm System you can have an ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System functional at a job site (vessel or dockside) within minutes. We are so confident in the life-saving capabilities of our ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System, we will make it available for a no-risk 30-day evaluation to qualified companies.

A kill switch or emergency cutoff switch is a safety mechanism used to shut off machinery in an emergency. Kill switches or emergency cutoff switches are manufactured in many forms for uses within different industries. For explanation purposes, we refer to the marine industry’s use of a kill switch as an engine-kill switch. Emerald Marine Products has been manufacturing a man-overboard alarm which includes the technology to turn off an engine since 1996. The ALERT Man-Overboard Alarm System effectively works as a kill switch for the boat’s engine, hence the term “engine-kill.”',
        //     headings: ['The Benefit of Engine-Kill Technology', 'Installing Engine-Kill Technology is Easy and Required by Law'],
        //     paragraphs: ['Engine-kill technology is one of the most important tools for man-overboard boat safety. A boat underway encounters various circumstances that could cause the pilot to be ejected from the boat. If the person ejected is the sole occupant, or the only person capable of maneuvering the boat, it’s a matter of life or death that the person can make it back to the boat. On average, using our ALERT Man-Overboard products, a quick engine-kill from a fall overboard can stop a boat within seven seconds. Making it possible to swim back to a boat. Another life-saving reason for an engine-kill on the boat is to prevent the “Circle of Death” a maneuver by an unmanned boat that will cause it to cruise in circles that could actually “run over” the person in the water. Here is a video highlighting the “Circle of Death” issue: https://www.passagemaker.com/trawler-news/uscg-requires-engine-cutoff-switches-on-more-boats?jwsource=cl', 'Since the 1970’s the United States Coast Guard (USCG) has investigated the risks of cruising solo with engine-kill technology installed on a boat. As the years have passed, technology to install engine-kill capability in a boat has evolved, making the installation and use of this life-saving technology easier, more affordable and less obtrusive. In December 2018, Soundings Trade Only Today magazine reported “in December (2018 Congress) passed the Frank Lobiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, which includes a provision requiring boat and engine manufacturers, distributors and dealers to install engine cutoff switches on new boats “less than 26 feet overall in length and capable of developing 115 pounds or more of static thrust.” The requirement pertains to inboards, outboards and sterndrives. The switches must meet American Boat and Yacht Council standards.” Click here for the full article. At Emerald Marine Products, we believe this technology is also essential for a solo fisherman and single-hander,regardless of boat size and date of manufacture.Even more important that someone who is operating a boat alone, is protected and safe in the event of a fall overboard. We also believe that the need to install an engine-kill technology increases as the value of the occupants increase. Any commercial fisherman should have engine-kill technology installed on their boat, as highlighted by one of our customers https://emeraldmarineproducts.com/testimonial/cruising-home-at-16-knots/.
